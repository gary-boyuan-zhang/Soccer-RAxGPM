# How to evaluate the impact of individual players on their team’s performance within a period of time?

---

# Plus-Minus (+/-) Model 

## Concept:

keeps track of the net changes in the score when a given player is either on or off the court

## Formula:

.center[**Plus-Minus for Any Player = (Team Points Scored - Team Points Allowed) While That Player is On The Court**]

## Benefits:

  - Identify a player’s implied effect on his team’s goal difference while he is on the field
  - Data required to compute Plus-Minus are already available: only need the player lineups and substitutions records with the times at which they occurred, and goals scored and their corresponding times
  - Could be employed in any league, on any match, at any time

## Problems:
  - A player’s effect on his team’s goal differential will change as the makeup of teammates and opponents changes during the game

---

# Adjusted Plus-Minus (APM) Model

## Concept:

Over a given time period, adjusting the basic plus-minus results to account for both the teammates and the opponents on the court.

## Formula:

$$\frac{T_{total}}{T_{j}} \Delta S = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \cdots + \beta_ix_i + \cdots + \beta_nx_n + \epsilon$$
  - $\Delta S$: Score differential, $S_{home} - S_{away}$
  - $T_j$: Length of time segment, the interval in which no substitutions or expulsions occurred, for $j = 1, \dots, R$ segments
  - $\beta_0$: Average home team advantage over all teams in the competition
  - $\beta_i$: Influence of player $i$ on goal differential, for $i = 1, \dots, N$ players in competition
  - $x_i$: Player appearance index:
    - +1: Player $i$ is playing at home
    - 0: Player $i$ is not playing
    - -1: Player $i$ is playing away

---

# Adjusted Plus-Minus (APM) Model

$$\beta^* = \arg \min_{\beta} ||\Delta S - tX\beta||_2^2$$

## Interpretation:
APM ratings indicate how many additional points are contributed to a team’s scoring margin by a given player in comparison to the league-average player whose APM value is zero over the span of a typical game.

## Benefits:

  - Reflects the impact of each player on his team’s scoring margin after controlling for the strength of every teammate and every opponent during each minute he’s on the court

## Problems:
  - High variance, overfitting, and sensitive to the noise
  - Multicollinearity: Coaches prefer to use some groups of players more frequently or rarely since all players could not be on the court with every other teammate at the same time

---

# Regularized Adjusted Plus-Minus (RAPM) Model

## Concept:

Adding regularization into APM model to improve model accuracy.

## Formula:

$$\beta^* = \arg \min_{\beta} ||\Delta S - tX\beta||_2^2 + \lambda||\beta||_2^2$$

## Benefits:

  - Significantly reduces standard errors in APM model and provide more accurate prediction results

## Problems:

  - Multicollinearity: Coaches prefer to use some groups of players more frequently or rarely since all players could not be on the court with every other teammate at the same time

# Problematic Nature of Soccer

knitr::include_graphics("https://www.intraocular.net/posts/how-augmented-apm-works/scoring_vs_subs_sports-1.png")
```

--

- Low number of substitutions $\Longrightarrow$ multicollinearity between features
- Low number of scoring $\Longrightarrow$ sparse response variable

- Recasting APM into a Bayesian framework, and incorporating FIFA ratings into the prior distribution
- Shown that Argumented APM predicts better than standard APM and a model using only FIFA ratings
- Shown that Agumented APM decorrelates players that are highly collinear

# RAxGPM with Box Score Prior

## Previous Formula:

$$\beta^* = \arg \min_{\beta} ||\Delta G - tX\beta||_2^2 + \lambda||\beta||_2^2$$
## New Formula:

$$\beta^* = \arg \min_{\beta} ||\Delta \mathbb{xG} - tX\beta||_2^2 + \lambda||\beta - \beta_{prior}||_2^2$$
  - $\Delta \mathbb{xG}$: Expected Goal differential, $\mathbb{xG}_{home} - \mathbb{xG}_{away}$
  - $\beta_{prior}$: Prior value for each player learned from **box score data**

## Idea:

  - More frequent response variable
  - Less collinearity between players

class: inverse center middle

# Example: English Premier League 2021-22 Season

---

# Data: Prior Stage

## Box Score Data: EPL season 2020-21 and 2021-22
- 3,420 observations and more than 180 features
- only consider player with 900 minutes and above in corresponding season
- after variable selection, around 30 features are left including the following criteria: 
  - Scoring, creating, dribbling, passing and defensive actions, etc.

## FIFA Ratings 2022 Data: before starts of 2021-22 season
- only collected one overall rating for each unique player

# Discussion

##Future Work

- adding more data, increasing sample size to enhance model training and prediction accuracy
- employing more supervised learning techniques to increase prior model quality
- bagging to improve the stability and the accuracy of RAxGPM model
- choice of response variable: could we find a better measurement for soccer?
- implementing tracking data to build a more comprehensive model
- constructing Bayesian framework to add uncertainty to the model through distribution

## Applications

- predicting player’s market value and salary
- optimal line-up recommendation
- predicting game results and simulating league result
- evaluating players across different leagues
